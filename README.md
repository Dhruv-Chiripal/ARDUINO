# ARDUINO
All my codes and circuit diagram for my Arduino projects

## 1. FIRE ALARM (Arduino based)
Completed my first Arduino project: a fire alarm system! 
Using an MQ-135 gas sensor, LM35 temp sensor, buzzer, and LED, it detects harmful gases & temperature spikes for immediate alerts, and LED, Buzzer reacts accordingly.

## 2. DANCING LIGHTS (with Arudino)
Completed my second Arduino project
Using a Sound Sensor, when it detects the sound the led lights grow accordingly.
